An app where people who can't or don't have the resources to make ideas and dreams come true post their ideas. 

## Description
- I was very new to web development when creating this.
- The goal of the app was to provide a website similar to Reddit, where startup ideas could be posted, the public could upvote/downvote an idea
- entrepreneurs, manufacturers, etc. could look for ideas, get into contact with "idea owners" and start working on 
- idea owners would have some way to protect their IP from being stolen
- I was, however, extremely underqualified at the time (still learning raw JS/HTML)
